# This is a `Unique Skill Training Toolkit` to tranfer your image data to valuable ownable skill with feature extractor powered by machine learning.

Step 1. creators train a model and download two files `model.json` & `model.weight.bin`\
Step 2. creators zip two files at [`https://car.ipfs.io/`](https://car.ipfs.io/)\
Step 3. creators upload `.car` file at [`https://nft.storage/`](https://nft.storage/) and copy the ipfs uri\
Step 4. creators set up 3 things: mint fee, supply, and uri and create minting smart contract on `Openskill` platform\
Step 5. users mint this ERC1155 token and enable to stake it on that minting smart contract address to earn back a part of the minting fee\
Step 6. users enable to download the uri contents to receive two files\
Step 7. users connects two files to the website and press `Start guessing`\
Step 8. users own a new skill 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
